# AWS, Github and OIDC labs
There are two labs you can try: 
  - a simple S3 deploy and clean up workflow.
  - an AWS api gateway access workflow.
## ⚙️ Getting started
- First, log in to Github.
- Click on the <> Code link in the github menu bar for this repository.
- Click on the green Use this template button in the top right and create a repo based on this template.


## 💻 Simple S3 deploy 
This lab can be run anywhere that you have permissions to create AWS IAM resources.
Get started with [these instructions](https://github.com/housten/OIDC-AWS-Lab/blob/main/Simple-AWS-Deploy-Lab.md).

## 🖥️ AWS API Gateway workflow
This lab uses an already configured API with routes set up already. The premise here is that in a larger organisation you probably have to order routes from an operations team.
